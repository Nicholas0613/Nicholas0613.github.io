title: "Info about Nicholas Lambkin"
---
Hi there! My name is Nicholas Lambkin, and I attend Excelsior Preparatory High School as a rising junior. I am seventeen years old, having been born on June 13, 2007. I was awarded a math prize in 2019 and I'm an honor role student. My goal is to work in business law as I like reading and solving problems.
